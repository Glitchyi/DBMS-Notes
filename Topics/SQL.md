}
```

### ALTER

ALTER TABLE <TABLENAME> ADD/DROP/MODIFY COLUMN (DATATYPE FOR ADD AND MODIFY)
```

### DROP
Remove the entire relation
```SQL
DROP TABLE <TABLENAME> RESTRICT /* ONLY IF NO ELEMENTS*/
DROP TABLE <TABLENAME> CASCASE /*DROPS ALL OBJECTS DEPENEDED ON THE VALUE*/
 ```
 
### INSERT
New tuples
```SQL 
INSERT INTO <TABLENAME> (ATTRIBUTE NAMES) VALUES (VALUES) 
OR
INSERT INTO <TABLENAME> VALUES (VALUES)
OR
INSERT INTO <TABLENAME> VALUES (SELECT * FROM <THINGS>)
```

### DELETE
To delete tuples
```SQL 
DELETE FROM <TABLENAME> WHERE CONDITION
```

### UPDATE
update values of tuples
```SQL 
UPDATE <TABLENAME> 
SET <VALUES>
WHERE <CONDITION>
```

### SELECT 
```SQL 
SELECT <ATTRIBUTE NAMES>
FROM <TABLES>
WHERE <CONDITION>
```

### DISTINCT
Removes redundant tuples
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT (<ATTRIBUTE NAMES>)
FROM <TABLES>
WHERE <CONDITION>
```

### LIKE 
Pattern matching situations as well as when looking for NOT NULL values
```SQL
SELECT <ATTRIBUTE NAMES> 
FROM <TABLES>
WHERE <CONDITION> LIKE <SOMETHING ELSE>
```

## Nested Queries 
A complete SELECT query, called a nested query, can be specified within the WHERE-clause of another query, called the outer query.

## Aggregate Functions 
Functions that act on a set of tuples and provide a single output
- SUM
- COUNT
- AVG
- MIN
- MAX

## GROUP BY & HAVING
The GROUP BY clause specifies the grouping attributes, which should also appear in the SELECT clause.
to apply condition to the groups that you just made we make use of the HAVING clause

## SQL Joins
#syntax 
### (INNER) JOIN:
- Select records that have matching values in both tables.
```SQL 
SELECT *
FROM <TABLE A> JOIN <TABLE B> ON <JOIN CONDITION>
WHERE <CONDITION>
```
### FULL (OUTER) JOIN:
 - Selects all records that match either left o right table records.
 ```SQL 
SELECT *
FROM <TABLE A> FULL JOIN <TABLE B> ON <JOIN CONDITION>
WHERE <CONDITION>
```
### LEFT (OUTER) JOIN:
 - Select records from the first (left-most) table with matching right table records.
```SQL 
SELECT *
FROM <TABLE A> LEFT JOIN <TABLE B> ON <JOIN CONDITION>
WHERE <CONDITION>
```
### RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN:

SELECT *
