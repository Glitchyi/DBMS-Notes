## Atomicity 
Either the entire transaction takes place at once or doesnâ€™t happen at all. There is no midway.

## Consistency 
Database is consistent before and after a transaction

## Isolation 
One transaction should start execution only when the other finished execution.

## Durability
Ensures that once the transaction has completed execution, the updates should
be permanent & they persist even if system failure occurs.
